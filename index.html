              "I did a lot of research before switching to Bonsai from another
              invoicing service. The ability to send and sign contracts was a
              game changer for me. No one else offers such a seamless process
              from proposal to contract to invoice. It has saved me a lot of
              time and lets me focus on creative work."

              "I've been a Bonsai user for years. It has allowed me to grow my
              career as a fulltime freelancer especially with the ease of making
              contracts and collecting payments. With a variety of clients that
              are all on different payment schedules, Bonsai provided options
              for each client without difficulty. Now I am enjoying Bonsai even
              more that they have added the additional accounting and tax
              assistance. This quarter I was able to save so much more time
              filing quarterly tax payments thanks to the tax assistance
              feature. Thanks, Bonsai for understanding what freelancers need at
              every stage of their freelance career."

              itself 2x over in the time I save having everything so seamlessly
              integrated. I love how I'm able to send professional-looking
              invoices, track billable and non-billable hours, create to-do
              lists, track finances/expenses, and even create contracts and
              proposals all in one place. The integration with Google Calendar
              is a huge plus, the customer service is beyond stellar, the
              platform is really intuitive and easy to use... Really can't say
              enough good things about it."

              built upon contract and proposal templates and were able to
              streamline our operations, as if we were already operating for
              years. Our clients have all been very impressed with our
              operations, and we owe a lot of that satisfaction to Bonsai.

              streamlined experience for my clients. Bonsai is my armor to get

              organized all of those documents without losing my sanity or
              letting something fall through the cracks. Thank you Bonsai!"

              "As a freelancer, I was recently burned by a client who refused to
              pay me for two months of very hard work done. After having to hire
              an attorney, I realized I needed a way to have stronger contracts
              with my clients. Bonsai helped me with that and so much more.
              Bonsai is my new favorite platform to help make my life easier:
              resourceful, easy to understand, aids in organization, and
              provides some protection for myself and my clients."
